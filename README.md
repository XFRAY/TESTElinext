This project is downloading images one by one and displaying in the screen as a page using RecyclerView and GridLayoutManager.
Inside it implemented custom GridPagerSnapHelper that allows you leaf pages one by one regardless how much images in the page.      
Here you can find APK of the app: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hTGfD30wasR3B90sZqbRvw11Pq5eSq9c?usp=sharing
